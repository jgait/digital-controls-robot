Repo for Cookie Monster the robot and Sesame Street Friends

This repository contains all of the info about our Digital Controls robot (MEEG667) at the Univeristy of Delaware. The project is to create a line follower robot that will traverse a course in a competition-style event at the end of the semester, with the goal of being the fastest group in the class (as well as learning some controls along the way). We have mustered up all of the controls and electronics knowlege that we've gained throughout the years to create this robot using not only a line follower array (via SparkFun), but also by dabbling with ROS2 - Humble with the goal of using machine vision with a camera on top.
